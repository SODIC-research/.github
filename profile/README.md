# 🌍 SODIC – Semantic & Open Data Innovation Chemnitz

**SODIC** is a research group at TU Chemnitz focused on advancing open and semantic data infrastructures.  
We explore how structured, interoperable and spatially linked data can foster innovation, transparency, and collaboration across public administration, science, and civil society.

## 🔍 Motivation & Vision

In a world increasingly driven by data, the accessibility, semantics, and interoperability of Open Data are more important than ever.  
SODIC stands at the intersection of technology, governance, and transparency – pushing for intelligent Open Data infrastructures that empower society, science, and administration.

## 🧪 Current Research

### [SODREPO – Spatial Open Data Regions and Portals](https://rambarz.github.io)

An interactive map-based tool linking Open Data portals to administrative boundaries across Europe.  
Introduced at ICEGOV 2025, SODREPO brings spatial context and metadata richness to the Open Data infrastructure landscape.

### SODINA - Sparql for Open Data Introspection, Navigation and Access

SODINA is a lightweight introspection layer for SPARQL endpoints, designed to support semantic data exploration by dynamically exposing available classes, properties, datatypes, and value samples. Inspired by GraphQL’s `__schema` functionality, SODINA lowers the entry barrier for users unfamiliar with the internal vocabulary of RDF-based Open Data portals.

### SODRAM - Specific Open Dataset Regional Analysis Metadata
This Node.js-based research tool analyzes the metadata quality of German municipal Open Data portals. Specifically, it evaluates the **regional assignability** of datasets depending on whether standardized metadata models like **DCAT-AP** and **GeoDCAT-AP** are used (typically via CKAN), best practice as a SPARQL endpoint, or non-standard formats (e.g. ArcGIS JSON).
